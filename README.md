# Dark Souls API ðŸ’€
> **Rails API that returns dark souls per game information.**

Dark Souls API is a project to learn how to build a API using Ruby on Rails Framework, understand how some gems works and improve my skills as a Ruby developer.

## What I'v been using to make it ðŸ“‘
- **Code editor:** VSCODE
- **Language:** Ruby (Rails)
- **Gems:** jsonapi-rails & jsonapi-serializer
- **Database:** sqlite

## Future plans (hope its happen)
I want to grow it on a API that have info about swords, items, armors with their respective id to help people modding, then the users can add to it and make it larger and larger. I want to put kinda filter to find easely what you are looking for.
